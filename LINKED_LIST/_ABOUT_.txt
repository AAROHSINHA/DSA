1. Linked List exists of nodes, which contain an value of any type and a memory address 
   to the next listnode.
2. Linked list is stored in head memory, so there is no continuous storage for it.
3. Linked List can be both grown or shrinked during the runtime as it is dynamically
   allocated.
4. Types of linked list are - singly ll/ doubly ll/ circular ll/ doubly circular ll.

5. Doubly Linked List also consists of ListNode which points to the next, as well as 
   the previous ListNode. It contains the data, nextPtr, prevPtr

6. In a circular linked list, the last node rather than pointing to null, points to the
   head node.

7. Doubly Linked list can also be circular. The next of last node points to the first 
   node and the prev of the first node points to the last node.
